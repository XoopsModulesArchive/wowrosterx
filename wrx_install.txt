 Please read the roster_install.txt before installing or using the WRX Module!!!
 
 1. Copy the "wowrosterx" directory to your Xoops module directory. 
 	** Make sure to download the image pack if you did not download "wrx_125_full.zip" **
 
 2. Go to your Xoops administration page and install the module using the install icon.
 
 3. After it has successfully installed the database tables, and configs, click on the Admin icon on the left.
 	** This is important that you run the configuration, as it not only lets you 
	   configure the guild but sets your directory paths to the Roster Root
	   
	   Also if it gives you an error about RosterLogin() just refresh the page two or three times **
	   
 4. Set your GuildName and ServerName in the Guild Info config and save.
 
 5. After setting a correct GuildName and ServerName, go to the Upload Profile/Profile Updater and upload your 
 	CharacterProfiler.lua and use the password "xoops" to update the Guild Info.
	
 6. Your Roster should now be all setup! Feel free to change the Update password on the right side of the Config. 
 	Also any non-admin user will not be able to see the roster configuration
	

Additional Info:

	* Blocks are not available in this version, however everything is set in case someone wants to play with them and make them work. 
	Currently the block functions and show/edit need to be added in "blocks/block_wrx_motd.php" and "blocks/block_wrx_realm.php"

	* Add-on database tables are NOT deleted with the other module tables, I am still looking for a solution to this.

	* Some Add-ons may not work properly, ie SigGen :(
	
	* Still looking for a better solution on the user display config, to show each user their Character Page Config. Currently only
	administrators can view any/all configuration settings. Other users will only be able to open the RosterDiag and Documentaion
	from the Roster Configuration.
	
	* Need to know how compatible this is! Tested and working on New Xoops 2.0.16 Install running Apache/2.2.3 (Win32) and 
	MySQL 5.0.27-community-nt with PHP 5.2.0

	
Enjoy this module and help make it better!
